    <h2>Become a white hacker or an ethical hacker</h2>
    <div class="grid-container">
      <div class="grid-item">What is a white hacker or an ethical hacker you might ask. Well when hackers appeared they were just 
        a bunch of people with the goal to make fun of others and steal their data. The terms of white hacker
        and ethical hacker means that you are a good hacker not a bad one. This sort of jobs are highly paid in
        companies and as far as today companies want more and more people on the cybersecurity team so you will
        not regret it. Every time you will need to make a decision for your own life so try to make a good one 
        and don't accept the temptation.</div>
