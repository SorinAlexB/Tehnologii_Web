# Web Technologies Repository

Welcome to the Web Technologies repository! This repository showcases my progression in web development, starting from basic HTML projects to more advanced ones involving HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Projects

### 1. HTML-Only Project

In my first project, I focused solely on HTML to build a basic web page. This project served as a foundation for understanding the structure and elements of HTML.

### 2. HTML and CSS Project

The second project expanded on the foundation laid in the first one by introducing CSS. This allowed me to enhance the visual appeal of the web page and gain a better understanding of styling.

### 3. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript Project

In the third and most advanced project, I incorporated JavaScript to add interactivity and dynamic features to the web page. This project demonstrates a comprehensive approach to web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
